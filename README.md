# 🧠 Road to Practitioner (R2P) – IBM Quantum Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal repository documenting my progress through the **Road to Practitioner (R2P)** program by IBM Quantum during **Spring–Summer 2025**.

This repo contains all the Jupyter notebooks, exercises, and notes I've worked on as part of this hands-on learning experience, covering the fundamentals of **quantum computing** and **Qiskit**.

   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
   ```

3. **Install requirements**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Launch Jupyter Notebook**:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
